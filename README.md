# MNIST-AUDIO-CLASSIFICATION

This is an audio version of MNIST dataset which contains audio samples of 10 labels (number from 0 to 9).

## Dataset

A simple audio/speech dataset consisting of recordings of spoken digits in wav files at 8kHz. The recordings are trimmed so that they have near minimal silence at the beginnings and ends.
